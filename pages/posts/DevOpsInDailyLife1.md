The time of year when I am applying to several internships. I'm browsing several blogs, YouTube videos, and feedback from various sources. To get the perfect output of "How to create the ideal resume and cover letter?" This is not a blog where I teach you how to write the perfect the professional documents(**pro-docs** like resumes and cover-letters). Instead I will help you save some time

I usually spend an hour or so researching and developing pro-docs rather than spending a whole day on it. Since, I improvise on almost daily basis, the pro-docs needs to be exported into PDF format. My preferred tool for creating pro-docs is Google Docs (**G-Docs**), which is a part of G-Suite. The PDF are then uploaded to a publicly available folder (Google Drive's Folder) so that I may distribute them on GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites.

It becomes monotonous, dull, burdensome, boring, tedious to

1. Make a few changes everyday(until the pro-docs are prefect).
2. Download the updated pro-docs.
3. Delete the old ones from the folder.
4. Upload the updated pro-docs.

One strategy would be to distribute the pro-docs directly as a Google Doc's link rather than the PDF.
The above tedious and repetitive tasks are all over! Right? No, this creates a new set of issues.

1. **Need for PDF**: The majority of employment sites demand that you submit your professional documents in PDF format. The process of opening the link and exporting to PDF is still included.

2. **50% Complete**: If I haven't finalised all of the revisions, this document will be available online in a partially finished state.

3. **Streaming mistakes live**: If you are revising the pro-docs and someone is looking at your resume, in G-Docs, at the same time. They may watch mistakes and advancements being made in real time. It can occasionally be a little humiliating.

The monotonous, dull, burdensome, boring, tedious tasks that I mentioned, these can be automated!

See [Part 2](/posts/DevOpsInDailyLife2) for implementation.
